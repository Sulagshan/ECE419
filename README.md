# ECE419
The code here is for the course project of University of Toronto course ECE419 Distributed System. The whole projects took us days and nights to finish. But the final outcomes were pretty good. 

There are four different milestones in the project, but we only have 3 milestone folders, since we build our m4 code based on the m3. And there is only one new feature in the m4 comparing to m3. m2 code is kind of buggy, but almost every problem has been fixed in the m3. 

Great work done by my teammates Ze Yang and Min Wu.
